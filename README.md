# Data-Analysis-and-AI
Repository description:
This repository contains a python code that performs basic data processing and data visualising on an example training dataset in order to analyse the data. It also implements some of the relevant AI methodology to establish relationships and classify the data accordingly. Certain techniques explored are clustering (KMeans, Hierarchical, EM algorithms), evaluated the conditional probabilities based on which a decision tree was constructed to predict the classification field which resulted in an accuracy of 97.97% . This decision tree model was then tested for its accuracy on a test dataset which was found to be 96.72%. The model was proved to be fairly accurate and the repository can act as an introductory example code for the various above mentioned AI techniques.


File summary:
This repository contains the datasets (both training and testing) upon which the the classification prediction model was built along with a commented and self explanatory code that performs various analytical tools to implement an AI that predicts the classification.
